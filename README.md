# My little retro site :purple_heart: by Junior Campos (a.k.a. laccuvit)

## Abstract:

Website created in React, using mainly the awesome React95 library. Gamify your resume!

---

## Roadmap/TODOS:

### Windows inner workings (let's use HOCs, yay!)

- [x] The start button workings
- [ ] Taskbar/window interface
- [ ] Desktop/window interface
- [ ] Better window/modal customization (contributing to @react95)

### Let's add some content too!

- [ ] Experiences page
- [ ] Studies page (lot to do on this one)
- [ ] Finish "about me" (not stylish enough/missing links)

---

After this line we're ready to deploy! :rainbow:

### Misc

- [ ] Command line interface
